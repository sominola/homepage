                  Having well-developed business mindset, I'm good at making effective plans, setting goals and working

                  I may also have excellent organisational and administrative skills, but that depends on how often I
                  skips the details in order not to lose sight of the bigger picture.

                    <p><strong>I Left School To Pursue Music</strong></p>

                      <li>Getting a start in music was certainly not easy for me.</li>
                      <li>Once I realized my work at the University
                        was going nowhere, I decided to drop out of school and head to New York City.</li>
                      <li> It was there I would begin seriously working on music, dedicating all of my time to
                        networking and
                        getting my material out there.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p><strong>I Used to Date Rhianna</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>One of the biggest controversies of my career is that I dated Rhianna for a short period of
                        time.</li>
                      <li>The details of their time together are mostly unknown, but many outlets and newspapers have
                        speculated about it.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                      <li>
                        I has always been interested in music and has played the drums since I was three years old.

                      <li>It took I a while to get someone else to release my music.</li>
                      <li>This is why in 2011 he announced that my first release would be an EP called Owl Pharaoh, a
                        collection of songs that would eventually become a full-length mixtape once I was discovered by
                        Kanye West.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                      <li>When I was 16, I formed a band with a few of my friends called The Graduates.</li>
                      <li>The band did not stick around for long, though, breaking up when the rapper went to college
                        only two years later.</li>

                      <li>In my current relationship with Kylie Jenner, I have shown that I would do anything for a
                        serious romantic moment.</li>
                      <li>For example, on Kylie's birthday, I ordered an entire orchestra to surprise her with a
                        concert.</li>
